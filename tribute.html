             Indian soldier whose attack on British officers on March 29, 1857, was the first major incident of what came to be known as 
            the Indian, or Sepoy, Mutiny (in India the uprising is often called the First War of Independence or other similar names).

                Pandey was born in a town near Faizabad in what is now eastern Uttar Pradesh state in northern India, although some
            give  his birth place as a small village near Lalitpur (in present-day southwestern Uttar Pradesh). He was high-caste 
            Brahman landowning family that professed strong Hindu beliefs. Pandey joined the army of the  british army East India 
            Company 
                 
                in 1849, some accounts suggesting that he was recruited by a brigade that marched past him. He was made a soldier )
             in the 6th Company of the 34th Bengal Native Infantry, which included a large number of Brahmans. Pandey was ambitious 
            viewed his profession as a sepoy as a stepping-stone to future success Pandey’s career ambitions, however,came into the 
            conflict with his religious beliefs. While he was posted at the garrison in Barrackpore in the mid-1850s, a new Enfield
            rifle was introduced into India that required a soldier to bite off the ends of greased cartridges in order to load the 
            weapon. A rumour spread that the lubricant used was either cow or pig lard, which was repugnant to Hindus or Muslims,the
            respectively. The belief arose among the sepoys that the British had deliberately used the lard on the cartridges.
